# A Decentralised KYC Verification Process for Banks - CASE STUDY

## Origin of KYC

 

Know your customer or KYC originated as a standard to fight against the laundering of illicit money flowing from terrorism, organised crime and drug trafficking. The main process behind KYC is that government and enterprises need to track the customers for illegal and money laundering activities. Moreover, KYC also enables banks to better understand their customers and their financial dealings. This helps them manage their risks and make better decisions.

 

## Need for KYC

Taking in from the origin of KYC, we can state that there are four major sectors in banking where KYC is needed. They are as follows:

Customer Admittance: This sector defines making anonymous accounts as restricted entry into the banking system. In other words, no anonymous accounts are allowed. Preliminary information, such as names, date of birth, addresses and contact numbers, is to be collected to provide banking service.

Customer Identification: In the case of suspicious banking transactions through a customer, customer accounts can be tracked and flagged. Further, they can be sent for processing under the bank head office for review.

Monitoring of Bank Activities: Suspicious and doubtful activities in any account can be zeroed in by the bank after understanding its customer base using KYC.

Risk Management: Now that the bank has all the preliminary information and the activity pattern, it can assess the risk and the likelihood of the customer being involved in illegal transactions.

 

These requirements make the KYC process an essential entity in the banking and financial world. The traditional KYC process is already in place in some banks, but there are major challenges related to the process, and through this case study, we will assess and tackle these challenges. Letâ€™s first list the challenges related to the traditional KYC process.

 

## Problems/Challenges in KYC
The disparity in specifications for KYC

Every bank has its own KYC process set up, and customers need to do the KYC again and again for each bank.

Due to the lack of KYC standards, compiling each request is time-consuming.

Adverse impact on customer relationship

It becomes irksome for customers to provide the same information to different banking entities and industries.

Banks sometimes even follow up with customers to get more details for KYC.

Escalating costs and time for banks

A recent study concluded that overheads of KYC in a bank increase the onboarding cost for a customer by 18% and the minimum time required to 26 days. 

## Solution Using Blockchain
The blockchain is an immutable distributed ledger shared with everyone involved in the network. Every participant interacts with the blockchain using a public-private cryptographic key combination. Moreover, immutable record storage is provided, which is extremely hard to tamper with.

 

Banks can utilise the feature set of blockchain to reduce the difficulties faced by the traditional KYC process. A distributed ledger can be set up between all the banks, where one bank can upload the KYC of a customer and other banks can vote on the legitimacy of the customer details. KYC for the customers will be immutably stored on the blockchain and will be accessible to all the banks in the blockchain.
